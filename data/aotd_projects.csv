ashesofohm_tesseractSalvageProject,Tesseract Salvaging,"Analyzing the debris and sensor data relating to your encounter with the unknown ships around the Hypershunt, we can attempt to salvage one of their ships. This will be a costly and timely endeavor, requiring a significant amount of the best electronics and machinery the sector has to offer as well as making use of our Hyperdimensional Processor with access to the power of a Coronal Hypershunt. It is unlikely we will be able to do this again without encountering more of their ships.","ashesofohm_tesseractSalvageProject_stage1:20,ashesofohm_tesseractSalvageProject_stage2:20,ashesofohm_tesseractSalvageProject_stage3:20",ashesofohm_tesseract:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",ashesofohm_tesseract:SHIP:1,Shoey.AshesOfOhm.ProductionProjects.SalvageTesseract,ShoeyAshesOfOhm
