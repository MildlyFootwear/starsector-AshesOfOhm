This will be a costly and timely endeavor, requiring a significant amount of the best electronics and machinery the sector has to offer as well as making use of our Hyperdimensional Processor. It is unlikely we will be able to do this again without encountering more of their ships.",true,true,$ashesofohm_canConstructReplicaTesseract,5,Structure Research;Systems Research;System Prototyping;Hull Prototyping;Construction,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,1000000,,60;60;60;60;30,"advanced_components:100,ships:10;advanced_components:150,domain_heavy_machinvery:50;advanced_components:100,domain_heavy_machinvery:50;ships:50,domain_heavy_machinvery:50;ships:20,domain_heavy_machinvery:50,advanced_components:50",Overall progress %s,Tesseract,ashesofohm_tesseract,Shoey.AshesOfOhm.ProductionProjects.TessReplica
